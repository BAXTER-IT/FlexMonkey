Multi-SWF/Multi Application

This sample uses a SWFLoader to load a separately-built SWF file and automates interactions with the newly-loaded SWF as well as the original SWF.

The separately built SWF is located at html-templates/QuoteOMatic.swf. It is NOT built with FlexMonkey linked in. The regular build process will move this SWF to the build directory, which is where the original TomSwftie1.swf file loads it from. The source for this application is below.

The tests run successfully from the FlexMonkey Console and from ant (on Mac OSX using Firefox). Modify build.properties if you want to try it.
